# UT_campaign_contributions

This project explores better visualizations of the campaign contributions to Utah state political races. 
Treemaps are currently used in a Shiny object, but while this is better than pie charts, it is not ideal. It is a work in progress.
To get a sense of the current visualization without running the Python and R scripts, view one of the .html files in the R_scripts folder. These are the current treemaps used in the Shiny app.

This project uses python to scrape and shape the data, and R to visualize.
