# UT_campaign_contributions

This project explores better visualizations of the campaign contributions to Utah state political races. 
Treemaps are currently used in a Shiny object, but while this is better than pie charts, it is not ideal. It is a work in progress

This project uses python to scrape and shape the data and R to visualize.
